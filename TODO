--- plan ---
the camera should follow the player, and we should make a grid as in example. i would rather my grid be primitives though.

--- ideas for iterative projects ---
tag: there's a bot that wants to tag you, then just runs left once it's no longer it
reverse pacman: you're the ghosts

--- unsolved problems ---
the world does not exist in units yet. it's easiest to read as a float if the 'room' is 100 units tall.
