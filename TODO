--- plan ---
i am currently trying to get the 2d and 3d camera to behave nicely together, so that when i make cool-looking spaceships i can see them clearly. i am also trying to orient them properly. my next step will be to have a crude 1v1 instagib battle with the bot. then i will slowly add content to that.

^ seems like this might be an easier way to do what i want
working on rendering a target: use https://bevy.org/examples/shaders/shader-material-2d/
i'm not satisfied with the movement abstraction; i want approach, orbit and targeting.
a good first step would be to introduce the idea of acceleration, velocity, facing, and turn time (rotational velocity)
how is targeting going to work? it seems like we could use entity names to fetch the target of a unit.
look at custom primitives link above to see how to make a targeting square like what i want

--- ideas for iterative projects ---
tag(done): there's a bot that wants to tag you, then just runs left once it's no longer it
star control: an enemy bot is trying to destroy you. you each shoot bullets. one hit kills. may orbit, approach, or flee

--- units ---
the units of the world are meters. if things are not the right scale for that to be reasonable, i messed up

--- goodies ---
#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
^ can make native and webasm versions work at once

--- notes on getting files out of the steam flatpak's blender ---
my "home" dir is ~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam

--- notes on making models in bevy that render the right way in this project ---
i haven't found the right way yet, but i will denote here once i know how
