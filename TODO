--- plan ---
our entities will be characters such as '@' rendered over a mesh2d background color. when i want to get more adventurous, i can render arbitrary 'primitives' in 2d or even 3d if necessary. i wonder if it would look acceptable to just have text and primitives with flat coloring.

--- ideas for iterative projects ---
tag: there's a bot that wants to tag you, then just runs left once it's no longer it
reverse pacman: you're the ghosts

--- unsolved problems ---
the world does not exist in units yet. it's easiest to read as a float if the 'room' is 100 units tall.
