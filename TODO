--- plan ---
i'm not satisfied with the camera following the player.
i'm not satisfied with the way i am laying out the map; i don't even know its size
i'm not satisfied with the movement abstraction; i want approach, orbit and targeting.

--- ideas for iterative projects ---
tag(done): there's a bot that wants to tag you, then just runs left once it's no longer it
star control: an enemy bot is trying to destroy you. you each shoot bullets. one hit kills. may orbit, approach, or flee

--- unsolved problems ---
the world does not exist in units yet. it's easiest to read as a float if the 'room' is 100 units tall.
