--- plan ---
it seems like i should just use the bevy example folder for my version; i've been looking at shader_material_2d.rs

https://bevy.org/examples/2d-rendering/mesh2d-alpha-mode/
^ seems like this might be an easier way to do what i want
working on rendering a target: use https://bevy.org/examples/shaders/shader-material-2d/
i'm not satisfied with the movement abstraction; i want approach, orbit and targeting.
a good first step would be to introduce the idea of acceleration, velocity, facing, and turn time (rotational velocity)
how is targeting going to work? it seems like we could use entity names to fetch the target of a unit.
look at custom primitives link above to see how to make a targeting square like what i want

--- ideas for iterative projects ---
tag(done): there's a bot that wants to tag you, then just runs left once it's no longer it
star control: an enemy bot is trying to destroy you. you each shoot bullets. one hit kills. may orbit, approach, or flee

--- unsolved problems ---
the world does not exist in units yet. it's easiest to read as a float if the 'room' is 100 units tall.

--- goodies ---
#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
^ can make native and webasm versions work at once
